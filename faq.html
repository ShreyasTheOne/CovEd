                        If you are a 6-12 student, you are eligible to register as a tutee for personalized mentorship 
                        and academic support from an undergraduate or postgraduate mentor.

                        <b>What tutoring services are available?</b><br>
                        We provide tutoring services for all school subjects from 6-12 
                        (including some competitve exam classes), mentorship, and college preparation (including 
                        help with preparing for the JEE(M/A) or NEET exams).

                        <b>How does tutoring work?</b><br>
                        Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, our tutoring sessions will be conducted online. 
                        We suggest using WhatsApp, Facebook, although 
                        this can be decided on a one-to-one basis between the tutor and tutee.

                        <b>I have signed up in the form. When should I expect to receive a match?</b><br>
                        For students, you should expect a match in a week. Please send us an email if you are not 
                        matched within that time frame. If you are a tutor, we unfortunately 
                        cannot guarantee a time for which you would be matched.

                        <b>How do I get matched with a tutor/ tutee? How does the matching process work?</b><br>
                        After filling out the registration form, we have a team that decides the best match based 
                        on the preferences you have indicated in the form and any special comments that you may have 
                        provided to us via the form

                        We suggest students and tutors meet between 1-2 hours a week, although this can 
                        be decided among mentorship pairs. This may depend on the student’s needs as well as 
                        the tutor’s availability.

                        <b>How long will CovEd tutors provide tutoring?</b><br>
                        We expect tutors to be able to help until the end of the academic year for the student. 
                        After the academic year is over, discussions between the tutor and tutee can 
                        help determine possible plans and whether or not the tutoring will continue.

                        <b>What are the responsibilities of a tutor?</b><br>
                        Tutors are responsible for volunteering a minimum of one to two hours a week of their time
                        to help their matched tutee with the subjects the tutee requests help in. 
                        While a tutor is only matched with one tutee, they can reach out if they would like to tutor more. 
                        Tutors are expected to help their tutee until the end of the 2020 
                        academic school year.

                        <b>How are you reaching students in disadvantaged situations?</b><br>
                        We have an outreach team that is actively working on recruiting students throughout the country. 
                        In our registration form, we ask questions pertaining to socioeconomic status, 
                        allowing us to ensure that these students are matched first.

                        <b>Can you help students that do not speak English very well?</b><br>
                        Yes! We have tutors that are fluent in various languages and if this is a concern, be sure to mention this in the special requests/concerns portion of the registration 
                        form and we will definitely work to accommodate this. Additionally, we are working on translating all flyers and publicity materials into different languages to reach 
                        students regardless of their first language.

                        One of CovEd’s goals is to ensure that all students have access to various resources to help stimulate educational growth during this time. We have a form where resources 
                        can be submitted.
